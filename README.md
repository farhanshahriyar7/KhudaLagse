## KhidaLagse - A Mobile Food Order App

### About

KhidaLagse is a full mini featured food-ordering app built with React Native and Expo. It covers the entire customer flow — from browsing food and viewing details to adding items to the cart, placing an order, tracking delivery progress, and downloading invoices.

The app includes a warm, modern design, smooth animations, persistent cart storage, and a complete checkout system with Cash on Delivery, bKash, and Nagad support. It’s built to be simple, fast, and fully optimized for mobile users.

The goal of this project is to create a clean, production-ready template that can be extended into a real food delivery platform.
